Programming Languages is an introduction to basic principles of defining, describing and implementing
programming languages and their interpreters. The fundamental goal is establishing a vocabulary for
discussing what programming languages and programs written in them do. Topics covered to accomplish
this are data representation and types; declarations, bindings and variable assignment; parameter
passing and function evaluation; statements; and objects and types. The course uses an
implementation-based approach with students developing interpreters for languages that demonstrate
features presented in class.
